FrameWork : 
Types : 
1)KeyDriven FW 
2)Data Driven FW
3)Method Driven FW
4)Hybrid FW 
5)BDD FW(Cucumber)
6)Robot FW

Hybrid FW (Method Driven FW  + Data Driven FW)


3 Stages for Framework : 
1) FrameWork Design
2) FrameWork Implementation
3) FrameWork  Execution


1)FrameWork Design
Here we have to list the all the requried softwares : like JDk,Ecplise,Browser,TestNG,Jars files
Also Files like : Test Data File,Driver EXE files
Here AA will Write reuseabilty Codes
We have creat Project Strcture in such way that it should standard and understandle to everyone
Here will create 3 Package
1)genaric : it conatians genaric codes : under src/main/java
2)pages : it conatins all POM classes : under src/main/java
3)test : it contains all Test Classes : under src/test/java : eligible to run

to open browser : 3 lines
to close browseer : 1 line
to take screenshot : 5 lines 
3+1+5 = 9 lines 
100 Test Class : 900 lines 

FrameWork Design
1.List all required software,Files,
2.Create Maven Project
3.Create the all packages in project(genaric,pages,test)
4.Create required folders(Screenshots,Drivers,Data)
Screenshots : to store screenshots of webpage
Drivers : to store the .exe files
Data : to store the Test Data
5.Add the dependecies in maven Project(https://mvnrepository.com/) 
selenium dependecies ,TestNG dependecies ,POI dependecies ,Commons IO dependecies 
After run the POM.xml file > Mvn test(BUILD SUCCESS)
6.Add the .exe files to Drivers floder.Test Data excel sheet to Data folder
7.Add the TestNG as libary to project 


genaric package : 
Key and value of .exe file these values we need in each and very time to open browser and 
To read the test data we need file path 
These values constanst values
constanst  : should not change or final value
Acc to java Interface is suitable place to store final values

1)Autoconstanct(I): Key and values of browser and File Path
2) BaseTest(AC) : contains 2 methods
 	1)precondition() : it will open browser and enter the URL
	2)postcondition() : it take the screenshot failed script and stores in scrennshot folder and closes the browser
3)GenericUtils(C) : it contains generic methods of selenium : like Select(C),Actions(C),to handle popups,frames,to take  the screenshots etc
4)ExcelData(C) : it contains generic methods to read Test Data
	1)getData() : to read the data form Excel sheet
	2)getLastRowNumber() : to get last row number of Sheet
	3)getLastCellNum() : to get the last cell of row
5)BasePage(C) : it conatins commons methods for verification


2) FrameWork Implementation 

To create POM class : under pages package
1)The Name of POM class should be Same as Title of WebPage and It should end with word Test
2)No of POM classes in a Framework equal to NO of WebPages in Application
3)The method name : Action Name (enterUserName)
4)Only Action should be performed (No Verifications)
5)All POM classes should extend the BasePage


To create Test class : under test Package
1)The name of Test Class should Same as Test Case ID or Name and should should end with word Test
2)No of Test Classes should be equal to no of Manual Test Cases
3)It should conatin atleast 1 @Test method 
4)Here we have to do verification 
5)verification is done by TestNG Assert Class
6) All test data should read from external resources
7) All test Classes should extens the Base Test

@BeforeMethod : To open browser and Enter URL 
@Test : Test Steps
@AfterMethod : To take screenshot of Failed Script and to close browser
8) Create POM class Object And call the Methods
